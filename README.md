# ðŸš€ PROJECT SETUP GUIDE

This project serves as a guide on how I set up every new project, following best practices to ensure code quality and maintainability.

## ðŸ“œ Table of contents

1. [**Enforcing Code Standards**](/configs/code-standards). Here I specified how to setup Husky to automatically run Prettier & ESLint before every commit. With this we guarantee the quality of our code.

2. [**Project Architecture**](/configs/folder-structure). Here I talk about different folder strucuters and which one could fit better the project needs.
